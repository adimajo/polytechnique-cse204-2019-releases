    "\n",
    "The goal of PCA is to perform an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, called _principle components_.  This can be thought of as fitting an n-dimensional ellipsoid to the observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset $X\\in R^{n\\times p}$, where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ the number of variables.  PCA transforms $X$ into a new coordinate system (new variable set), such that the greatest variance in the data is captured in the first coordinate, and then the second, and so on.  More specifically, the transformed coordinates $T \\in R^{n\\times p}$ are written as a linear combination of the original dataset,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T = X W, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W \\in R^{p\\times p}$ is the transformation matrix.  The first column of $W$, denoted as $w_1$, is constructed to maximize the variance of the transformed coordinates.\n",

    "The ratio in the last term is known as the _Rayleigh quotient_.  It is well known that for the positive, semidefinite matrix $X^T X$, the largest value of the Rayleigh quotient is given as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix, where $w$ is eigenvector associated with that eigenvalue.\n",

This technique has been widely used to reduce the dimension of large-dimensioned datasets by accounting for the directions of largest variance in the data, while neglecting the other directions.  In addition, this can also be used to remove noise from a dataset, in which it is assumed that the noise accounts for a small degree of variance, compared to the true underlying parameterization.

By contrast, JPEG image compression can obtain compression ratios of 23:1 with reasonable image quality, surpassing the quality of reconstructions with PCA.  For that reason, PCA is not really used for image compression, but it has been used in a number of other fields, particularly in physics and engineering.\n"

Autoencoders are neural networks which are trained to output their input in such a way that they learn a reduced dimensional space of the input distribution.  They are general composed of two distinct layers. The first encodes the input space (encoder) and the second decodes the encoded space back to the original feature space (decoder).  There are 3 basic types of autoencoders:\n",
    "1. __Undercomplete__ autoencoders work by constructing a network that has a hidden code layer that has fewer nodes than the input and output layers.  After training, the smaller hidden layer will represent an encoding of the input onto a lower dimensional space.\n",
    "2. __Regularized__ autoencoders use various regularization terms in the loss function during training to constrict the space of the output.  For example, sparse autoencoders add a sparsity regularization term in the loss to force as many nodes in the hidden layers to be zero.\n",
    "3. __Variational__ autoencoders work slightly differently than the previous two.  In this case, the autoencoder learns parameters that model the distribution of the input data in the encoder.  The decoder is then used to reconstruct the output based on a random sample from this distribution.  Some variational autoencoders have been used for image generation. \n",
