    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn to create a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch using only the Numpy package for matrix-vector operations.  In order to train the network on several datasets, you will need to implement the back-propagation algorithm with gradient descent.  Before getting started, let's review the notation we will use in this lab and recall the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider simple feed-forward networks that can be described by the following recursive relationship,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "&z^l = a^{l-1} W^l + b^l,\\\\\n",
    "&a^l = \\sigma^l(z^l),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a^l$ is the output (activation) of layer $l$ which is a nonlinear function $\\sigma^l$ of a linear transformation of the previous layer's output.  The linear transformation is performed using the weight matrix $W^l$ and bias vector $b^l$ associated with the layer $l$.  We will denote the last layer in the network with a capital $L$ superscript.  The recursion is stopped by setting $a^0 = x$, where $x$ is the input vector to our network.  Note that in the recursive expressions above, we implicitly assume that our input/output vectors are row vectors.  The reason for this will be evident later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking this notation into account, we see that a network with $L-1$ hidden layers is fully expressed by its $L$ weight matrices, bias vectors, and activation functions.  We can denote the set of trainable parameters in our network by $\\theta = \\{ W^1, \\dots, W^L, b^1, \\dots, b^L \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are only concerned with supervised learning tasks.  Recall that in supervised learning, we have a dataset represented by a list of $(x, y)$ pairs where $x$ is the input to our model and $y$ is the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For regression problems where we want to fit a function $y = f(x)$, $x$ is the independent variable vector, and $y$ is the function value.\n",
    "- In classification problems, $x$ will correspond to a set of attributes and $y$ the corresponding label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of supervised learning is to \"train\" our network by adjusting its parameters in order to minimize a cost function over the entire training set,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_\\theta \\mathcal{L} = \\min_\\theta \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{p=1}^N \\ell_p \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\ell_p$ is just a short-hand notation for $\\ell_p = \\ell(a^L(x_p), y_p)$ and $\\ell(\\hat{y}, y)$ denotes the particular form of the loss function being considered.  In this lab, we will use 2 different loss functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quadratic Loss: $\\ell(\\hat{y}, y) = \\|\\hat{y} - y\\|^2 / 2$\n",
    "2. Cross-entropy Loss: $\\ell(\\hat{y}, y) = -\\sum_j[ y_j \\ln\\hat{y}_j + (1-y_j)\\ln(1-\\hat{y}_j)]$\n"

You can think of this like a ball rolling down a hill to find the minimum of the topology.  Only in this case, the ball is massless because it has no momentum.  When this update rule is applied to a random subset of the total dataset, it is called stochastic gradient descent (SGD).  SGD is far more efficient than GD when the batch size is large enough to approximate the true gradients while being significantly smaller than the full dataset.  Running over the entire dataset with SGD once is called an epoch of training.\n",

    "### Back-Propagation\n",

    "From the GD update rule above, it is clear we will need to compute the gradients of the network parameters with respect to the cost function.  This is exactly what back-propagation does, and thus is a crucial component to almost all neural network learning algorithms.  In the next exercise, we will derive the 4 equations in back-propagation.  You will need knowledge of the [chain rule for differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) if you are not already familiar with this.\n",
